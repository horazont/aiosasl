Using SASL in a protocol
========================

To make use of SASL over an existing protocol, you first need to subclass and
implement :class:`SASLInterface`.

The usable mechanisms need to be detected by your application using the
protocol over which to implement SASL. This is generally protocol-specific. For
example, XMPP uses stream features to announce which SASL mechanisms are
supported by the server.

When a set of SASL mechanism strings has been obtained by the server (let us
call a set with the mechanism strings ``sasl_mechanisms``), the mechanisms
supported by your application (a list of :class:`SASLMechanism` subclass
instances, let us call it ``mechanism_impls``) can be queried for support::

    # intf = <instance of your subclass of SASLInterface>
    for impl in mechanism_impl:
        token = impl.any_supported(sasl_mechanisms)
        if token is not None:
            sm = aiosasl.SASLStateMachine(intf)
            try:
                await impl.authenticate(sm, token)
            except aiosasl.AuthenticationFailure:
                # handle authentication failure
                # it is generally not sensible to re-try with other mechanisms
            except aiosasl.SASLFailure:
                # this is a protocol problem, it is sensible to re-try other
                # mechanisms
            else:
                # authentication was successful!

The instances for the mechanisms can be re-used; they do not save any state,
the state is held by :class:`SASLStateMachine` instead. The different
mechanisms require different arguments (the password-based mechanisms generally
require a callback which provides credentials).

The mechanisms which are currently supported by :mod:`aiosasl` are summarised
below:

.. autosummary::

   ANONYMOUS
   PLAIN
   SCRAM
   SCRAMPLUS

Interface for protocols using SASL
==================================

To implement SASL on an existing protocol, you need to subclass
:class:`SASLInterface` and implement the abstract methods:

.. autoclass:: SASLInterface

.. autoclass:: SASLState

SASL mechanisms
===============

.. autoclass:: PLAIN

.. autoclass:: SCRAM(credential_provider, *[, after_scram_plus=False][, enforce_minimum_iteration_count=True])

.. autoclass:: SCRAMPLUS(credential_provider, cb_provider, *[, enforce_minimum_iteration_count=True])

.. autoclass:: ANONYMOUS

Base class
----------

.. autoclass:: SASLMechanism

A note for implementers
-----------------------

The :class:`SASLStateMachine` unwraps `(SASLState.SUCCESS, payload)` messages
passed in from a :class:`SASLInterface` to the equivalent sequence
`(SASLState.CHALLENGE, payload)` (requiring the empty string as response) and
`(SASLState.SUCCESS, None)`. The two forms are equivalent as per the SASL
specification and this unwrapping allows uniform treatment of both
forms by the :class:`SASLMechanism` implementations.

SASL state machine
==================

.. autoclass:: SASLStateMachine

Exception classes
=================

.. autoclass:: SASLError

.. autoclass:: SASLFailure

.. autoclass:: AuthenticationFailure

Version information
===================

.. autodata:: __version__

.. autodata:: version_info
